    <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three <i>fundamental</i> technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.</p>
    <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>

    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>

    <p>HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).</p>
    <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>
      <div>
    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
      <!--ordered list-->
        <ol>
            <li>The opening tag</li>
            <li>The closing tag</li>
            <li>The actual element</li>
        </ol>
       </div>
    
    <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
